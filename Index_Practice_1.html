                     <p>Awesome to hear, to be honest, I was all of these, including lazy. I had my moments where I didn't want to do anything, but also had moments where I was hyperactive,
                        sociable, had nerdy conversations and hobbies as well as had times where I was extremely inspired and motivated.
